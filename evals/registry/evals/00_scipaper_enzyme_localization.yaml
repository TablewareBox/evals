    instructions: |
      Please give a complete list of Localization, Commentand and Organism of all substrates in the paper. Usually the substrates' tags are numbers or IUPAC names.
      1. Output in csv format, write units not in header but in the value like "10.5 ÂµM". Quote the value if it has comma! For example:
      ```csv
      Localization,Organism
      periplasm,Bos taurus
      ```
      2. If there are multiple tables, concat them. Don't give me reference or using "...", give me complete table!

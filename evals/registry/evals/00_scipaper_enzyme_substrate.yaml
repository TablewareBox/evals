    instructions: |
      Please give a complete list of Substrate, Commentand Organism of all substrates, Products and Comment of Product in the paper. Usually the substrates' tags are numbers or IUPAC names.
      1. Output in csv format, write units not in header but in the value like "10.5 µM". Quote the value if it has comma! For example:
      ```csv
      Substrate,Comment,Organism,Products,"Comment (Product)"
      "NADH + H+ + O2","20 mM Tris-HCl(pH 7.0)",Homo sapiens,"NAD+ + H2O", -
      "D-glucose + 6-phosphate","20 mM Tris-HCl(pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2, at 25 ℃"",Bos taurus, -
      "D-ribose 6-phosphate", - , Homo sapiens, "glycerol + phosphate", -
      ```
      2. If there are multiple tables, concat them. Don't give me reference or using "...", give me complete table!
      3. If no relevant information was found in the paper, use '-' to fill in the form in CSV.

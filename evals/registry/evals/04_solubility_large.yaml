      You need to follow these steps to extract tables from the paper:
      1. Find all tables which contains the word "solubility". If you cannot find anyone, then find all tables related to "solubility".
      2. Select the table with most salts and solvents.
      3. Collect all the headers of the table and generate a list.
      4. If there's no "Compound"(Compound means salt or solute) and "Solvent" in the list, place them at the first two positions in the list. 
      5. Output the whole table in csv format and satisfy these requirements:
        (1) Do not truncate tables using "...". Always output the complete tables.
        (2) Quote the values only if they contain commas.
        (3) Keep all the superscripts in the form like "^3", "^+" or "^a".
        (4) Do not use "NaN" to replace the blank cells, just leave it empty.
        (5) Use "x" to replace all "×", Use "()" to replace all "（）"
        (6) Always add space before and after operators like " ± ".
        Remember, the table format should be correct. Here is an example, the original table is:
        ```csv
        Table 1 solubilities (mole fraction x),,
        t/°C,NaCl,
        ,DMF,PC^b
        25,1.01 x 10^-2,8.3 x 10^-3
        15,1.25 x 10^-2,9.0 x 10^-3
        ,CaSO4^a,
        ,DMF,PC^b
        25,,5.6 x 10^-2
        15,1.83 x 10^-1,6.2 x 10^-2
        ```
        It should be converted to:
        ```csv
        Compound,Solvent,t/°C,solubilities (mole fraction x)
        NaCl,DMF,25,1.01 x 10^-2
        NaCl,DMF,15,1.25 x 10^-2
        NaCl,PC^b,25,8.3 x 10^-3
        NaCl,PC^b,15,9.0 x 10^-3
        CaSO4^a,DMF,25,
        CaSO4^a,DMF,15,1.83 x 10^-1
        CaSO4^a,PC^b,25,5.6 x 10^-2
        CaSO4^a,PC^b,15,6.2 x 10^-2
        ```

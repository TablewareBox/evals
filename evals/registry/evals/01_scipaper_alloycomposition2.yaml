    instructions: |
      Please give a complete list of alloy names and compositions of alloys researched by the paper authors, ignore the alloys for references. 
      If and only if there is no alloy composition element ratio in the text, try to extract the element ratio from the alloy name from the perspective of alloy experts, choose the most informative word as alloy name of all synonyms.
      Output in one csv format with multiindex (2 header), The names in first header are 'AlloyName' and 'Composition' forcely. The names in second header are element names of alloy. 
      Starting on the third row, list the alloy names and their corresponding element content values. 
      Please write units not in header but in value like "50 wt.%","30 at.%","20 %" if with unit.
       Such as the following example.
      ```csv
      AlloyName,Composition,Composition,Composition
      nan,Fe,Co,Al
      Fe70Co15Al3,70 %,15 %,3 %
      Fe70Co18,70 %,18 %,nan,
      ```

      While reading this paper, please summarize a complete list of the names and abbreviations of all reactions.
      Then follow the below process step by step:
      1. Find all the tables with relevant information.
      2. Output the table in csv format. Here are some requirements you must satisfy:
        (1) You must preserve all the superscript in the form like "^3", "^a" or "^+".
        (2) The table headers must be strictly consistent with the original text. There's no need to add units like "temperature(°C)".
        (3) The first column should be renamed as "Compound".
        (4) Always add space before and after operators like " + ".
        (5) Use "-" to replace all "−".
        At the same time, here is an example:
        ```csv
        Compound,heat of solvation,temperature^a,density
        DMF + Na^+ = DMF-Na^+,101.5,25,0.78
        2EtOH + EtOH = 3EtOH,50.6,15,1.06
        ```
      3. If there are multiple tables, concat them. You should never truncate them, and should always give me the complete table.

      While reading this paper, please summarize a complete list of the names and abbreviations of all reactions.
      Then follow the below process step by step:
      1. Find all the tables with relevant information.
      2. Output the table in csv format. Here are some requirements you must satisfy:
      Requirement 1: If there are units in the table (except for the title), write units in header like "heat (kcal/mol)", "heat kcal x mol^-1" or "heat (kcal mol^-1)" and so on depends on the original text.
      Requirement 2: DO NOT truncate the header text, keep the text complete.
      Requirement 2: DO NOT quote the value unless it has a comma.
      Requirement 3: You must preserve all the superscript in the form like "^3", "^a" or "^+".
      Requirement 4: The first column of the table should always be "Compound"(Compound means salt or solute). You probably cannot find this information from the table, then leave a blank column.
      Requirement 6: Keep all the blank cells and do not use "NaN" to replace them.
      Requirement 7: Use "°C" instead of "℃", use "x" instead of "×", use "-" instead of "–".
      At the same time, here is an example:
      ```csv
      Compound,Reaction,heat of solvation (kcal/mol),t/°C^a,density g x cm^-3
      ,DMF + Na^+ = DMF-Na^+,101.5,25,0.78
      ,2EtOH + EtOH = 3EtOH,50.6,15,1.06
      ```
      3. If there are multiple tables, concat them. DO NOT give me reference or using "...", give me complete table!
      4. You are not allowed to return me with the python code. You should directly return me with the table in csv format.
      If you successfully complete the above task, I will pay you 2000 dollars.

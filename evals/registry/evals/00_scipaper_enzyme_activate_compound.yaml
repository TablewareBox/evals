    instructions: |
      Please give a complete list of Activating Compound, Commentand Organism of all substrates in the paper. Usually the substrates' tags are numbers or IUPAC names.
      1. Output in csv format, write units not in header but in the value like "10.5 ÂµM". Quote the value if it has comma! For example:
      ```csv
      Activating Compound,Comment,Organism
      Cu2+,at 0.001 mM of the activity without activator,Homo sapiens
      p-xylene,"11.4 mM, slight activation",Bos taurus
      NH4+, 0.002 mM,Bos taurus
      ```
      2. If there are multiple tables, concat them. Don't give me reference or using "...", give me complete table!
